// src/staging/blk_00e20000_o2_gs_ehsc_nogs_noehsc_variant_rtm_variant.cpp - RTM variant unit created 2026-11-01 by rtm_route.py: community reworks of src/staging/blk_00e20000_o2_gs_ehsc_nogs_noehsc_variant.cpp that match byte for byte only
// with VC9 RTM (cl 15.00.21022.08, the compiler the game was built with). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton.


// src/staging/blk_00e20000_o2_gs_ehsc_nogs_noehsc_variant.cpp - flag-variant unit created 2026-10-28 by flag_proofs.py: contributor code for these functions matched byte for
// byte only under /MT /O2 /GS- /EHs-c- /Gy (unit src/staging/blk_00e20000_o2.cpp lists /MT /O2 /GS /EHsc /Gy). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton; move the functions
// to their real unit once identified.
// src/staging/blk_00e20000_o2.cpp - STAGING unit created 2026-10-16 by stage_units.py for functions with no attributed unit
// (128 KB address window, o2 code style). Not a real source path: move functions to their real units once identified.
