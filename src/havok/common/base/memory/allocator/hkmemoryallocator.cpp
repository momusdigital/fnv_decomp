 * Unit: pack/pack.json symbol FUN_00cbf280, 67 bytes, __thiscall member of a
 * five-slot class, three stack parameters, returns a pointer, cleans 0xC.
 *
 * Every identifier below is a placeholder chosen for readability. The binary
 * carries no type, field or method names. The prose describes what the unit
 * provably does (which values reach which callee) and what that most likely
 * means; the two are kept separate and the guesses are marked as guesses.

 * Free helper reached by the unit's only non-virtual call.
 * Canonical mangled symbol: ?FUN_00d2caa0@@YAXPAX0I@Z
 *   @@YAX      -> __cdecl, returns void
 *   PAX, 0     -> void *, void *   (0 back-references the first void *)
 *   I          -> unsigned int
 * so the declaration must be exactly this: a plain C++ free function, not an
 * extern "C" block and not a CRT intrinsic. Its own body is out of scope here;
 * the call site hands it a destination, a source and a byte count, which is
 * consistent with a bounded copy (inference, not verified).

 * not decidable from this unit; a named field is the narrower assumption, so

 * Body, in the order the effects are observable:
 *
 *   1. Reserve(args) is called first and its pointer result is kept alive for
 *      the whole function; it is what gets returned.
 *   2. args->limit is re-read *after* that call, so the unit deliberately
 *      honours a limit the callee may have adjusted. It is then clamped
 *      against the caller's `size` with a signed comparison, i.e. the smaller
 *      of the two wins.
 *   3. FUN_00d2caa0 receives (destination from step 1, src, clamped count) in
 *      that positional order.
 *   4. Commit(src, size) is called with the *unclamped* size, and its result is
 *      dropped.
 *   5. The destination from step 1 is returned.
 *
 * Read as a whole this looks like: ask the owner for somewhere to put data,
 * copy at most min(size, args->limit) bytes of `src` into it, tell the owner
 * how much was asked for, and hand the buffer back. The "looks like" is
 * deliberate — the semantics of Reserve, Commit and the helper are not
 * established by this unit.
