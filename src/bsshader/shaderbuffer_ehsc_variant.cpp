// src/bsshader/shaderbuffer_ehsc_variant.cpp - flag-variant unit created 2026-10-27 by flag_proofs.py: contributor code for these functions matched byte for
// byte only under /MT /O2 /GS /EHsc /Gy (unit src/bsshader/shaderbuffer.cpp lists /MT /O2 /GS /Gy). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton; move the functions
// to their real unit once identified.
