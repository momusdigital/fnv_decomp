"""Check a change against the tree it starts from, without the game: the automatic check on pull requests.

main matches the game byte for byte (tools/build_and_match.py proves it with your own executable). A change keeps that
true when every function it can affect compiles to exactly what the unchanged tree compiles to, at its original
address: the same bytes once every relocation is resolved through build/units.json as build_and_match.py resolves it
(a global named in code and the same address written as a constant are the same bytes in the game), only padding
after it, and the same EH code in the units that list EH tails. A string or floating-point literal counts by its bytes,
never by an address (build_and_match.py finds it in the game by its bytes, and build/units.json may not bind it), and
data the unit defines at a bound address (a global's initializer) counts by its bytes as well: a change to a literal's
value or to an initializer is a change, whatever build/units.json says. Renaming a function, a parameter or a type therefore
passes, as long as build/units.json gets the new decorated names at the same addresses; changing what any function
compiles to fails.

                                      units to build (split into shards); BASE and HEAD are clean git checkouts, and

                                      rules hold and everything checked is identical

                                      for the owner: the EH digests of every unit whose EH code differs at HEAD_SHA,
                                      for tools/verified_eh.json, after a full build of HEAD_SHA against the game

The rules (plan): only src/, include/, build/units.json and *.md files may change. With --trusted (a push to main, or
a pull request opened by the repository owner) .github/ and tools/ may change as well: this check cannot vouch for
them, the owner verifies them with a full build_and_match.py run, and main is built against the game after every
change. In build/units.json units pair up by source (and their order among units with the same source): units may be
added, removed or reordered, change their compiler or their options (only those in FLAGS), bind names to addresses
and give functions to each other, because every unit whose entry changed is built at both commits and every compiled
copy of a function must match one of main's copies at the same address. What stays: every function's address and
size, each unit's EH tails and literals, and the totals (apart from the number of units). A function that uses EH code
(itself or through a fold alias) stays in its unit: build_and_match.py finds EH tails only through the functions of the
unit that lists them. EH code resolves names through the whole recipe, so when those names change in any way, every
unit with EH tails is built again. Two lists in tools/ (main's, never the change's) stand in for what only the game can
tell: unwind_names.json, the destructors only unwinding code calls (at addresses build/units.json lists), and
verified_eh.json, EH code the owner has built against the game (the game places EH code by its EH tables, which this
check does not follow). Each function is listed once per unit, and its fold aliases must compile to exactly its code. Anything else
(build/image_check.json, patches/, a symlink, a source outside src/ and third_party/) needs a maintainer.

A file whose change is only in comments and whitespace inside lines (nothing else moves) cannot change any function,
so its includers are not rebuilt; __LINE__ is used only to name static-assert typedefs, and a change that adds a new
__LINE__ use is rebuilt in full. The compilers come from FNV_MSVC9_ROOT etc. as for build_and_match.py. Object files
stay in a temporary folder and are deleted; results hold addresses and counts only.
